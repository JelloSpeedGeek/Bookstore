description: When young writer-director Quentin Tarantino burst onto the scene in 1992 with Reservoir Dogs, it was clear that a major new voice in filmmaking had arrived. A knock-out storyteller with a gift for fiery dialogue and a unique take on human violence, Tarantino took home the coveted Palme D'Or Award at Cannes only two years later for his extraordinary Pulp Fiction---which went on to earn him an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Kill Bill is Tarantino's debut novel, an extraordinary work of fiction that will speak powerfully to his many admirers. It's the story of The Bride, a world-class assassin and a retired member of the elite, all-female Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS), who's ready to settle down to a quiet life of marriage and family. But the DiVAS, led by their ruthless leader Bill, have other plans for her. They turn up at The Bride's wedding, murder her entire wedding party, leaving her and her unborn child for dead. Five years later, The Bride awakens from a coma and sets out on an international rampage to enact revenge on Bill and the gang. Wickedly funny, black as night and shot through with razor-edged dialogue, Kill Bill is Tarantino in a new medium --- a stunning new incarnation of his unique talent. The brilliant, devastatingly original debut novel from legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino
